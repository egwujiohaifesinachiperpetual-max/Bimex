## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- `EnRevision` state: projects require admin approval before accepting funds
- `admin_aprobar()` and `admin_rechazar()` contract functions
- `Rechazado` state with `motivo_rechazo` field
- `doc_hash` (BytesN<32>): SHA-256 document hash stored on-chain for verifiability
- `calcular_yield_detallado()`: returns yield broken down by CETES and AMM
- `estado_capital()`: returns current capital distribution
- `solicitar_continuar()`: allows a new owner to resume an abandoned project
- `bimex-indexer`: on-chain indexing service to extend persistent storage TTL and maintain event history

### Fixed (security audit)
- CEI pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions) applied in `contribuir()`, `retirar_principal()`, `reclamar_yield()`, and `abandonar_proyecto()` — prevents reentrancy attacks
- `require_auth()` moved to the start of every function that requires it, before any storage reads or business logic
- Contribution cap: `cantidad = cantidad.min(restante)` prevents accidental or malicious overfunding
- Top-up preserves the backer's original timestamp (additional contributions no longer reset the yield clock)
- `solicitar_continuar()` resets `timestamp_inicio` so the new owner does not inherit accumulated yield from the previous period
- `calcular_yield_seguro()` uses early division to avoid i128 overflow with large capitals
- Bounds check in `inicializar()`: `yield_cetes_bps` and `yield_amm_bps` cannot exceed 10,000,000 bps

### Changed
- Yield rates updated to production values: CETES 9.45% APY (`yield_cetes_bps = 945`), AMM 4.00% APY (`yield_amm_bps = 400`)
